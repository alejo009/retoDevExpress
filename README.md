How was it addressed?

First I did exploratory tests to get to know the platform and then I thought about the logic of how I could automate the scenario where the user writes an incorrect captcha code, I first thought about how to write the feature well and then see what locators I needed and then write the tasks


The other login scenario could not be automated since it has a captcha that cannot be automated
